Using several managed metadata service instances in a farm requires some
configuration. Each Service Application Proxy Group can only have one
service application proxy configured as default for keywords or site
collection specific term sets.

This resource has to be configured in conjunction with the SPManagedMetadataServiceApp
resource and allows to specify which managed metadata service application proxy
should be used as default for the proxy group.
